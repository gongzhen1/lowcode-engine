## ‚ú® Features

- üåà An extension-oriented kernel engine extracted from an enterprise-level low-code platform, pursuing the design concept of the smallest kernel and the strongest ecology
- üì¶ Out-of-the-box high-quality ecological elements, including material systems, setters, plugins, etc.
- ‚öôÔ∏è A complete tool chain, supporting the full-link R&D cycle of ecological elements such as material systems, setters, and plug-ins
- üîå Powerful expansion capability, has supported nearly 100 various vertical low-code platforms
- üõ° Developed with TypeScript, providing complete type definition files

## üéØ Compatible Environments

- Modern browsers (Chrome >= 80, Edge >= 80, last 2 safari versions, last 2 firefox versions)

## üìö Engine Protocol

The engine fully implements the "LowCodeEngine Basic Construction Protocol Specification" and "LowCodeEngine Material Protocol Specification". The protocol stack is a key part of whether materials in the low-code field can be circulated.

## üå∞ Usage example

```bash
npm install @felce/lowcode-engine --save-dev
```

> **TIPS: Only cdn import is supported, npm package is used to provide code hinting capabilities such as typings**

```ts
import { init, skeleton } from '@felce/lowcode-engine';

skeleton.add({
  area: 'topArea',
  type: 'Widget',
  name: 'logo',
  content: YourFantasticLogo,
  contentProps: {
    logo: 'https://img.alicdn.com/tfs/TB1_SocGkT2gK0jSZFkXXcIQFXa-66-66.png',
    href: '/',
  },
  props: {
    align: 'left',
    width: 100,
  },
});

init(document.getElementById('lce'));
```

### Engineering configuration:

```json
{
  "externals": {
    "@felce/lowcode-engine": "var window.AliLowCodeEngine",
    "@felce/lowcode-engine-ext": "var window.AliLowCodeEngineExt"
  }
}
```

### cdn optional method:

#### unpkg

```html
https://unpkg.com/@felce/lowcode-engine@1.4.1/dist/js/engine-core.js
https://unpkg.com/@felce/lowcode-react-simulator-renderer@1.4.1/dist/js/react-simulator-renderer.js
https://unpkg.com/@felce/lowcode-vue-simulator-renderer@1.4.1/dist/js/react-simulator-renderer.js
```

#### npmmirror

```html
https://registry.npmmirror.com/@felce/lowcode-engine/1.4.1/files/dist/js/engine-core.js
https://registry.npmmirror.com/@felce/lowcode-react-simulator-renderer/1.4.1/files/dist/js/react-simulator-renderer.js
https://registry.npmmirror.com/@felce/lowcode-vue-simulator-renderer/1.4.1/files/dist/js/react-simulator-renderer.js
```

#### jsdelivr

```html
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@felce/lowcode-engine@1.4.1/dist/js/engine-core.js

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@felce/lowcode-vue-simulator-renderer@1.4.1/dist/js/react-simulator-renderer.js
```

#### Method 5: Use your own cdn

Pass the files under packages/engine/dist and packages/react-simulator-renderer/distÔºàpackages/vue-simulator-renderer/distÔºâ in the source code to your cdn provider

## üíª Local debugging

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:fe-lce/lowcode-engine.git
$ cd lowcode-engine
$ npm install
$ npm run setup
$ npm start
```

> üì¢ npm access speed is slow, Alibaba employees can use tnpm, other students recommend using cnpm or specifying a mirror registry.
>
> üì¢ Windows environment must use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), other terminals are not guaranteed to work normally

After lowcode-engine is started, several umd files are provided, which can be debugged in combination with the [lowcode-demo](https://github.com/fe-lce/lowcode-demo) project. Refer to the file proxy rules [here](https://lowcode-engine.cn/site/docs/participate/prepare).
